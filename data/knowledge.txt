The heavy velvet curtains of the carriage were drawn back, allowing Ambassador Corvus of the Vylosian Empire to look out at the dying land.

He sat comfortably, sipping wine poured from a crystal decanter, while his carriage idled at the border checkpoint of the **Silver Valley**. This was the land King Aswin had ceded to Vylos five years ago—the diplomatic concession that had cost Aswin his heavy cavalry and sparked a civil war.

Now, under Vylosian rule, the valley was quiet. The roads were paved; the patrols were regular. But just a few hundred yards south, past the stone markers that defined the border, the world descended into madness.

"It smells," Corvus muttered, wrinkling his nose.

"Sir?" his adjutant asked, looking up from a stack of documents.

"The air, Lieutenant. It smells of sulfur and rot."

It was the **Plague of Ash**. The wind was blowing south from the Razorback Mountains today. The Coalition—that greedy cabal of miners—was tearing the earth apart so violently to fund their mercenaries that the dust was poisoning the very air. Corvus watched a grey haze drift over the trees, settling on the refugees lined up at the border gate.

There were thousands of them. Hollow-cheeked mothers clutching silent children, men with missing limbs, farmers whose skin hung loose on their frames. They were fleeing the "Faithful" in the Emerald Basin. It was a dark irony: the peasants were fleeing the very faction that claimed to fight for them.

"The border guards report another three hundred attempts to cross since dawn," the Lieutenant said. "Mostly from the Basin. They say Mother Yara’s militias are burning the grain silos to keep food out of Royalist hands. The people are eating tree bark."

Corvus swirled his wine. "Starvation is a weapon, Lieutenant. A crude one, but effective. General Kaelen knows that. He was a good soldier once, before he decided he was a messiah."

"Do we let them in, sir?"

"No," Corvus said simply. "Close the gates. If we feed them, the pressure on King Aswin drops. We need the pressure high. We need the pot to boil over."

The carriage lurched forward as the barrier was raised, not for the refugees, but for the Ambassador. He was crossing into the war zone. His destination was the capital, **Auralia**.

As they rolled through the countryside, the devastation was absolute. The famous rice paddies of the north were scorched black. The stillness was eerie. Vylos had been watching this war for five years, an apex predator watching a wounded deer thrash in the water.

"It is a tragedy," the Lieutenant said softly, looking at a burning farmhouse in the distance. "King Aswin studied in our universities, didn't he? He wanted to make Daksh like us."

"That is the tragedy, yes," Corvus replied, adjusting his silk cuffs. "Aswin tried to build a Vylosian house without Vylosian foundations. He wanted our industry but despised our discipline. He wanted our secularism but didn't understand that you cannot kill a god without offering a replacement."

Corvus looked at the dossier on his lap. It contained the Treaty of Protection. It was a polite name for total surrender.

The intelligence reports were clear.

* **The Royalists** were down to their last reserves of gold.
* **The Coalition** in the mountains was rich but suffering from the sickness they created.
* **The Faithful** had the numbers, but pitchforks do not stop the disciplined muskets of the Vylosian Imperial Army.

The war had done the hard work for Vylos. It had broken the spine of the nation.

"They call him the Visionary," Corvus mused. "He saw the future, indeed. He just didn't see that he wouldn't be the one to rule it."

In the distance, the white towers of Auralia came into view. Even from here, Corvus could see the damage. The great domes were cracked. The ethereal glow of the Lumina streetlamps—once the envy of the continent—flickered and died in patches, like a failing heartbeat.

"Prepare the seal," Corvus ordered, his voice devoid of emotion. "We arrive within the hour. Tonight, King Aswin will have a choice. He can be the King of a graveyard, or the Governor of a Vylosian province."

"Do you think he will accept, sir?"

Corvus looked out at the smoke rising from the horizon, blotting out the sun.

"Look at his kingdom, Lieutenant," Corvus said, closing the curtain. "He has run out of moves. He has run out of friends. And most importantly, he has run out of time. The Anvil of the Sun is broken. We are just here to pick up the pieces."
